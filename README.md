# 7GUIs in Elm

An implementation of the [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) tasks in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

This implementation uses Elm at its simplest, with no UI libraries, and just using the HTML produced by the own Elm compiler.

Each task main module has a top level comment with points that are worth explaining and my thoughts on that task result.

## GUIs

The 7 GUIs can be interacted with by using `elm reactor`, but are also publicly available here:

* [Counter](https://aeqz.github.io/7guis-elm/Counter.html)
* [Temperature Converter](https://aeqz.github.io/7guis-elm/TemperatureConverter.html)
* [Flight Booker](https://aeqz.github.io/7guis-elm/FlightBooker.html)
* [Timer](https://aeqz.github.io/7guis-elm/Timer.html)
* [CRUD](https://aeqz.github.io/7guis-elm/Crud.html)
