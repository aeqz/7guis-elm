# 7GUIs in Elm

An implementation of the [7GUIs](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/) tasks in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

This implementation uses Elm at its simplest, with no UI libraries, and just using the HTML produced by the own Elm compiler.

Each task main module has a top level comment with points that are worth explaining and my thoughts on that task result.
